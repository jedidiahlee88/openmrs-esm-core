# Using the Extension System

The extension system makes it possible for frontend modules to
insert UI elements into each other, and for these interactions
to be configurable by system administrators.

A number of resources are available for learning about it.

Introductory presentation: [Quick Guide to Slots](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mQxh7qAYLD-gc9sh0I58t4o_XNndPcu6hAJmTZQZ_fo/edit#slide=id.gbe34f6b087_0_34 )

For a terse technical description of the extension system, see the
[Extensions RFC](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-rfc-frontend/pull/27/files).
