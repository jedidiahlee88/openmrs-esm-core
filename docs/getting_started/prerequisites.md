# Prerequisites

If you haven't already done so: Please first see [the Implementer Documentation](https://wiki.openmrs.org/x/pQJiDQ), which provides some conceptual orientation as well as instructions for deployment and configuring.

Before developing OpenMRS Frontend 3.0, you should be familiar with the following technologies.

## Javascript

Knowing Javascript is prerequisite to everything else. Consider 
[Introduction to Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) and [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/).

## JavaScript Tooling

You'll want to understand the basics of [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/),
including the command-line interface (run `npm help`), [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json), [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx), and know what [node](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/) is.

If the repository you're looking at has a `yarn.lock` file, then it uses `yarn`,
and you'll want to read the [Yarn docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started).
Otherwise it uses `npm`. Yarn and npm are exclusive of each other within a repository.

### Lerna

Most OpenMRS 3 projects use Lerna. If the repository you're looking
at has a `packages` directory at the top level,
then it is a "monorepo" and is using Lerna, and you'll want to read the
[Lerna docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#readme).

## React

You should know everything from [React Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html),
and sections 1-5 of [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

If you're new to React, use a tutorial or interactive learner's guide.
The [Learn React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn) is an excellent resource.
You can also try the
[React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
or the video-based [React JS Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8).

Take your time. This is a lot of material. The better you understand it, the more
easily you will be able to develop high-quality frontend modules (and other React applications).

## TypeScript

You can get started with Typescript pretty quickly. If you're new to it,
please read [TypeScript in 5 Minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).

## Git

It is imperative that you keep your code in a version control system. OpenMRS uses
[Git](https://git-scm.com/). You should know the basics of using Git and GitHub.
The website [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) and the video
[Git and GitHub for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
are excellent resources.
