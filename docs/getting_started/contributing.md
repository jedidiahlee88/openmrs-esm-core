# Contributing

You can write your own frontend modules and build the UI features that you
need for your implementation. However, it can be more fun and fruitful to
collaborate, producing frontend modules that can be useful to various
implementations and organizations.

As such, there are lots of frontend modules and architectural elements which are
managed by the OpenMRS community. If you're interested in contributing, you'll
need to take the following steps.

- Get access to [OpenMRS Jira](https://issues.openmrs.org).
    If you don't have access, raise a request at the
    [Help Desk](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/~helpdesk).
    Wait at least 24 hours for the request to get approved; you will receive an
    email upon approval. Once approved, take a look at all the
    [frontend module-related issues](https://issues.openmrs.org/projects/MF/issues).
    Good first issues are filed under the
    [intro](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/MF-508?jql=project%20%3D%20MF%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20labels%20%3D%22intro%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC)
    label.
- Join our [Slack Channel](https://openmrs.slack.com/archives/CHP5QAE5R) and introduce yourself.
You will first need to [create an OpenMRS Slack account](https://slack.openmrs.org/) if you don't have one.
- Read the [Contributing guidelines (RFC #20)](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-rfc-frontend/blob/master/text/0020-contributing-guidelines.md).
